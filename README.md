Harvard Capstone Project - Movie Recommendation System

Purpose of this Capstone Project is to Build a Recommendation Sysem based on Movielens Datasets that Predict Movie rating using Machine Learning Algorithm.  Our Ultimate Goal is to construct a Final Model that Minimizes the loss, measured by our loss function, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

This Repository contains 4 Files as follow:

1. recommendation-system.R       * R Code File for Movie Recommendation System Final Machine Learning Model Building.
                                 * System also Generate .rda Files for recommendation-system.Rmd in Step 2.
                                 * Run Time is approximately 25 Minutes to complete the whole process.

2. recommendation-system.Rmd     * R Markdown File for Generating PDF Data Science Report.
                                 * Must Run recommendation-system.R in Step 1 (At Least Once) before Generation of Report in Step 2.
                                 * Run Time is approximately 4 Minutes to complete the Generation of PDF Report.

3. recommendation-system.pdf     * Data Science Report (PDF Format) Generated from R Markdown File in Step 2.

4. recommendation-system-git.md  * Data Science Report. (Markdown for Github Format)
